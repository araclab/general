"bigfuti, sb27, nigeria"	el 2	106? From sb 27	[pending] Maybe one from each subset needed	"Review group_2996, 813, ymfR for co-location as separate element"		
"bigfuti, sb 27, nigeria "	el 42		leave as-is			
"bigfuti, sb 27"	el 45 		leave as-is			
"bigfuti, sb 27"	el 50	Gene_EL50_group_1453	leave as-is		"only low correlation in pork, ok in all other hosts for bigfuti"	
"bigfuti, sb27"	el 10		NA		not present at all	this element is not in the model
"sb 27, nigeria "	el 18		leave as-is			Can change to 2 or more if we generate more human markers
sb 27	el 19		leave as-is		only low correlation in beef	
sb 27	el 35		leave as-is			Track group_5709 and group_4287
sb 27	el 41		leave as-is
